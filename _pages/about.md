<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am currently a Research Fellow at the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, National University of Singapore (NUS). Prior to that, I have received a Ph.D. degree from the National University of Singapore, supervised by Prof. [Haizhou Li](https://colips.org/~eleliha/) (IEEE Fellow) and Prof. Shuzhi Sam Ge (IEEE Fellow). During my PhD studies, I  was a visiting research scholar at National Institute of Informatics (Japan), supervised by Prof. Junichi Yamagishi. I also studied at the Speech Processing Courses Summer School at the University of Crete, supervised by Prof. Yannis Stylianou (IEEE Fellow). I received a B.Sc degree from Nanjing University, Nanjing, China in 2017.

My research interest includes automatic lyrics transcription, speech recognition, speech-to-singing conversion, singing information processing, music information retrieval and multi-modal processing. I have published more than ten papers in leading journals and conferences, including IEEE/ACM Transaction on Audio, Speech and Language Processing (TALSP), Speech Communications, IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP), INTERSPEECH, APSIPA, SMC and ICOT.
